2. **Himalayan Brew** – Famous for its freshly roasted beans and friendly baristas.
3. **Forest Hideout** – A quiet place to read or write, tucked away in the woods.

### Sweet Treats

Don't miss the homemade cakes and cookies at every stop. The walnut brownie at **Mountain Delights** is a local favorite and pairs perfectly with a hot chai.
